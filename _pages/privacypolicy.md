# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Billy’s app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

<br>

## 1.0 Information We Collect

New Billy accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses or passwords.
You may optionally add an email address and a password, or link your social account (Facebook or Apple) to your Billy account, or remove the email address and password from your account, at any time in Billy’s app. Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, user interactions and sending notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.

<br>

## 2.0 Technical basics

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.
If you upload files to Billy, we need to store them until you delete them.
Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

<br>

## 3.0 Ads and analytics

Billy’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
No personal data is used to target Billy’s ads.

<br>

## 4.0 Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our app and customer support.
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Billy’s functionality.
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

<br>

## 5.0 Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Billy iOS app.
Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.
Billy may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

<br>

## 6.0 California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

<br>

## 7.0 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our app from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our app is structured to attract anyone under 13.

<br>

## 8.0 Information for European Union Customers

By using Billy and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

<br>

## 9.0 Information for Brazilian Customers

By using Billy and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of Brazil.

<br>

## 10.0 Your Consent

<br>

## 11.0 Contacting Us
